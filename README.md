# European-Option-Pricing-Calculator

This **Tech x Finance** personal project was inspired by one of the assignments I did for my [40.242 Derivative Pricing & Risk Management](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40242-derivative-pricing-risk-management/) course at SUTD.


I decided to go a step further & created a European Option Pricing Calculator using **_Tkinter_** in Python which automatically calculates call & put option prices using algorithms such as:
- **Put-Call Parity**,
- **Monte-Carlo Simulation**,
- **Binomial Option Pricing Model** &
- **Black-Scholes Method**.

These option pricing algorithms were built using the following Python libraries: **_NumPy_**, **_Math_** & **_SciPy_**.

The final version of the app is a standalone executable file created using **_PyInstaller_** that is capable of running independently on devices with no Python installation!


**HOW THE APP WORKS...** ðŸ’¸
