# European-Option-Pricing-Calculator

This **_Tech x Finance_** personal project was inspired by one of the assignments I did for my [40.242 Derivative Pricing & Risk Management] (https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40242-derivative-pricing-risk-management/) course at SUTD.

I decided to go a step further & created a European Option Pricing Calculator using **_Tkinter (GUI library)_** in Python which automatically calculates call & put option prices using algorithms such as **_Put-Call Parity_**, **_Monte-Carlo Simulation_**, **_Binomial Option Pricing Model_** & **_Black-Scholes Method_**. These option pricing algorithms were built using the following Python libraries: **_NumPy_**, **_Math_** & **_SciPy_**.

**How the app works...** ðŸ’¸
